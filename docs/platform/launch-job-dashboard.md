With QCentroid's **no-code** executions feature, you can launch jobs directly from the platform dashboard **without having to write a single line of code**.

You can run any problem and any solver that is available to you.

To launch a job:

1. Go to the section **Problems** through the left side menu
1. Then, click on the problem you want to execute, to go to its detail page
1. Scroll down to the **Execute problem** section
1. Select the input data for this execution. You can chose one of these options:
    - ***Manual custom input*** copy-paste or write the input data in JSON format
    - ***Data file*** select one of your previously uploded data files
    - ***Latest inputs*** use one of your latest inputs again with just one click
1. Select the solvers you want to run: from just one solver to all of the available ones
1. Click the **Execute** button

You will receive a confirmation message saying that a new job has been launched.

You can now go to your jobs section to see the job results.
