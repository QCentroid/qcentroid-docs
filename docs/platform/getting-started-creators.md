# Getting started with the Platform

These pages will guide you on how to **create your own problems and solvers** on the platform.


## First steps

To use the QCentroid Platform, you will want to start at the ***Problems*** section.

This section shows all the Use Cases currently available on the platform.

You can start here and **create a solver for one of the existing problems** or **create your own problem**.
