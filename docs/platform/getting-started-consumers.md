# Getting started with the Platform

These pages will guide you on how to **execute solvers** on the platform.

## First steps

To use the QCentroid Platform, you will want to start at the ***Problems*** section.

This section shows all the Use Cases currently available on the platform.

You can start here to select the problem you want and launch a job to run its solvers.
